BTP:

1. Working on approaches related to enhancing robustness by optimizing the portfolio
performance in worst-case scenarios.  
2. Currently, implementing robust optimization techniques in the framework of 
uncertainty sets and comparing it with the Markowitz model.
3. Future directions: Aim to extend the same to a multi-period model and
incorporating coherent measures of risk like AVaR.
